Interrupt Driven Music in BASIC 
David Saphier 2016

With help from Adrian Brown for the IM2 logic
VT2 routine - Sergy Bulba
bas2tap - Martijn van der Heide
bin2ap - 2009 mike/zeroteam

Intro
-----

This script (build_tape.bat) will create a TAP file from a collection on binary files. The files are already compiled and all you need to 
add is the music file. Simple take a pt3 song and place in the same dir as the script then run :

build_tape.bat mysong.pt3

A tape will be created, and the IM routine, VT player, Setup and music will be added to the tap. Simply load in an emulator and run the
for music playback in 128k & 48k Basic!

If your song makes you creep over 49152, you will no longer be able to use use 128K basic and must use 48k.

You can also try dropping the pt3 files onto the script. Use Vortex Tracker II to convert other formats.
